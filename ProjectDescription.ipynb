    "Asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. The fate of an asteroid is a complex function of its initial mass, speed, trajectory angle and internal strength. \n",

    "[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid) 10-100 m in diameter can penetrate deep into Earth’s atmosphere and disrupt catastrophically, generating an atmospheric disturbance ([airburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst)) that can cause [damage on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo). Such an event occurred over the city of [Chelyabinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor) in Russia, in 2013, releasing energy equivalent to about 520 [kilotons of TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) (1 kt TNT is equivalent to $4.184 \\times 10^{12}$ J), and injuring thousands of people ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642); [Brown et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12741)).

    "* The larger of the total kinetic energy loss or the residual kinetic energy in kt at impact with ground (cratering)\n",
    "* The horizontal path length across Earth's surface in m from the entry point to the burst point (impact point for a cratering event)\n",

    "You should also develop a simple interface for a User to interact with your tool (e.g., jupyter notebook, command-line arguments or example python scripts) and documented functionality to produce simple graphical output of the evolution of the asteroid in the atmosphere (e.g., plots of mass, speed, energy, etc., as a function of altitude or time).\n",

    "5. Correct identification of high risk postcode sectors for a specified impact scenario (meteoroid parameters and entry location and bearing) and specified uncertainties on each input parameter (**10 marks**).\n",
